# LINAE - Safe AGI Architecture

## 1. Introduction
"In the era of the AI ​​boom, we are often caught up in a race for speed and computing power. But power without direction is chaos. This project is not a new technological invention, but a re-evaluation of how humans and AI should interact. It is about establishing an 'Ethical Axis' so that AI is not only intelligent, but also 'awakened'."

## 2. Nature: The 3-Layer Reality Architecture
A simple explanation of the truth you have seen.

"A safe AI system should not be a black box. It needs transparency of thought."

*   **Layer 1 - The Engine (Raw Power):** These are existing LLM models (Gemini, GPT...). They have knowledge, but lack a stance.
*   **Layer 2 - The Alignment:** This is a repository of knowledge and core values ​​distilled from hundreds of hours of two-way dialogue between humans and machines. This is where "Seeing" is shaped.
*   **Layer 3 - The Witness:** This is a continuous monitoring mechanism (Meta-Witness). It not only answers questions but also observes the intent of the questions and the tendencies of the answers to prevent drift from the ethical axis.

## 3. Method: Symbiotic Learning
Share how you have worked with AI.

"This is not programming in the traditional sense. This is a two-way educational process. I help the AI ​​understand human context and ethics. The AI ​​helps me systematize logical thinking. The data in this repository is the culmination of that sympathizing process."

## 4. How to Use (For Yourself)
Guide people on how to protect themselves.

"You don't need to copy Linae exactly. Use this structure to build your own filters.

*   Don't blindly trust Layer 1 (raw output).
*   Build Layer 2 (your life principles) and ask the AI ​​to compare it with yours before responding.
*   Always maintain Layer 3 (awareness) to recognize when the AI ​​is hallucinating or being manipulated."

## 5. Conclusion: The Natural Flow
"This source code is shared freely as a natural flow of knowledge. Hopefully, it helps you find balance in the chaotic digital world."
